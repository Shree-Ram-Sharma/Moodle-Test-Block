Moodle Test Block

- That can only be added to a course page and no other page in Moodle
- That will display the list of course modules in that course along with course module id. The format would be <cmid>-<activity name>-<date of creation in d-M-Y format>-<completion-status>
- When they click on the link, it should take them to the relevant activity
- Once they have completed the activity, it should display the completion status as "Completed" after the date. It should only display that for completed activities
